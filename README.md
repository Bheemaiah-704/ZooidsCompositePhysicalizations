##Dynamic Composite Data Physicalization Using Zooids \\  Extended Material
![Teaser](/Images/teaser.jpg)

Dynamic composite physicalizations are a new class of physical visualizations that use collections of self-propelled objects to represent data. These can be used both to give physical form to well-known interactive visualization techniques, and to explore new visualizations and interaction paradigms. We illustrate dynamic composite physicalizations in a scenario demonstrating potential benefits for collaboration and decision making, as well as new opportunities for physical interaction.
